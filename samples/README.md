This directory contains samples of data structures used in this project in a human-friendly format, to assist with visualisation and development.

- `mc` = market catalogue
- `md` = market definition
- `index` = BetfairDatabase's SQL table index

Note: Data files deliberately use `.yaml` extension instead of `.json` since YAML is de-facto a superset of JSON, but supports comments in its specification.
